# Programming Tips

While certain things arent required, they are a good practice for documentation and note keeping 

For example you should include a header to know when the last modification was to make sure you have the right version 

```C++
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/*                                                                            */
/*    Module:       main.cpp                                                  */
/*    Program:      Your Program Name                                         */
/*    Author:       Authors                                                   */
/*    Created:      MM/DD/YYYY                                                */
/*    Modified:     MM/DD/YYYY                                                */
/*    Description:  Team Number's Code for the 2024-2025 Season               */
/*                                                                            */
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
```

Other good coding practices include

- Consistent naming scheme popular ones are "snake_case" (uses underscores as spaces) and "camelCase" (marks new words with a capital letter)
- Reference Block to denote important information like Port numbers
- Commenting to clear up confusion while debugging
